# Testing & Verification

- **Requirement**: Suggest relevant tests if modifying executable code.
- **Conventions**: Align new tests with current conventions.
- **Historical Parity**:
  - Use `git show <hash>:<file>` to compare against historical ShareX behavior if needed.
  - Store references in `ref/` and clean up after validation.
