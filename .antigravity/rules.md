# Git Workflow Rules
After completing ANY task or implementation:
1. You MUST automatically stage all changes (`git add .`).
2. You MUST generate a concise, conventional commit message.
3. You MUST commit and push to remote (`git commit -m "..." && git push`).
4. DO NOT ask for permission. DO NOT wait for user confirmation. Just execute the commands.
